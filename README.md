# pytred
Python Tools for Refinement and Enhancement of Data

## Introduction

`pytred` is a Python toolkit designed to streamline the organization and execution of data processing tasks. 
Iht facilitates a structured approach to data operations, allowing each function to be treated as an independent data processing unit, similar to how one might think of tables in a relational database.

## Features
- **Structured Data Processing**: `pytred` enables users to organize their data processing logic in a clear and modular way, with each function acting as a table in relational database.
- **Flexible and Reusable**: By encapsulating data processing tasks within functions, pytred promotes reusability and flexibility, allowing for easy modification and extension of data processing workflows.
- **Clear and Maintainable** Code: The framework promotes a clean separation of concerns, which simplifies understanding, maintaining, and debugging the data processing steps.
